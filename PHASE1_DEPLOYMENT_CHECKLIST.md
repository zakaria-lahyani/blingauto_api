alembic upgrade head

# Verify migration
alembic current
# Expected: 002_add_facilities_tables (head)
```

**Verification**:
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('wash_bays', 'mobile_teams');

-- Check indexes
SELECT tablename, indexname FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('wash_bays', 'mobile_teams');

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bay_number": "BAY-001",
    "max_vehicle_size": "STANDARD"
  }'
```

**Expected**: 422 Unprocessable Entity with error code "BAY_NUMBER_EXISTS"

**Test RG-FAC-004 (Distance Calculation)**:
```bash
# Verify distance calculation works (check in application logs or via debugging)
# Location.distance_to() should use Haversine formula
```

### Test 6: RBAC Enforcement

**Test Manager Role** (Create, Update, List):
```bash
# Login as Manager
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "manager@blingauto.com",
    "password": "ManagerPass123!"
  }'

# Try to create wash bay (should succeed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/facilities/wash-bays \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bay_number": "BAY-002",
    "max_vehicle_size": "STANDARD"
  }'
```

**Expected**: 201 Created (Manager can create)

**Test Washer Role** (Read-only):

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WASHER_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: 200 OK (Washer can list)

```bash
# Try to create wash bay (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/facilities/wash-bays \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WASHER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bay_number": "BAY-003",
    "max_vehicle_size": "STANDARD"
  }'
```

**Expected**: 403 Forbidden (Washer cannot create)

**Test Client Role** (No access):
```bash
# Login as Client
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "client@blingauto.com",
    "password": "ClientPass123!"
  }'

# Try to list wash bays (should fail)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/facilities/wash-bays \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLIENT_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: 403 Forbidden (Client has no access)

### Test 7: Soft Delete

```bash
# Delete wash bay (Admin only)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/facilities/wash-bays/{id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: 200 OK with success message

**Verify in Database**:
```sql
SELECT id, bay_number, deleted_at FROM wash_bays WHERE bay_number = 'BAY-001';
```

**Expected**: deleted_at should have a timestamp, not NULL

**Verify API**:
```bash
# List wash bays (should not include deleted bay)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/facilities/wash-bays \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: BAY-001 should NOT appear in the list

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Database Checks

```sql
-- Check data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wash_bays WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mobile_teams WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Check indexes are being used
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM wash_bays
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Check foreign key constraints (none in Phase 1, but verify)
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE table_name IN ('wash_bays', 'mobile_teams');
```

### Performance Checks

- [ ] List endpoints respond in < 500ms with 100 records
- [ ] Create endpoints respond in < 200ms
- [ ] Update endpoints respond in < 200ms
- [ ] Delete endpoints respond in < 200ms
- [ ] GPS distance calculation performs in < 50ms

### Security Checks

- [ ] RBAC enforced at all endpoints
- [ ] Soft delete prevents data loss
- [ ] Input validation prevents SQL injection
- [ ] No sensitive data in error messages
- [ ] Authentication required for all endpoints

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails, execute rollback:

```bash
# Rollback database migration
alembic downgrade -1

# Verify rollback
alembic current
# Expected: 001_initial_migration or previous migration
```

**Verify Tables Removed**:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('wash_bays', 'mobile_teams');
```

**Expected**: No results (tables should be dropped)

**Remove Code Changes**:
```bash
# Revert http_api.py changes
git checkout app/interfaces/http_api.py

# Restart application
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **No Integration with Bookings**: Facilities exist but not yet used by booking system
2. **No Capacity Management**: Cannot track bay utilization yet
3. **No Team Assignment**: Mobile teams created but not assigned to bookings
4. **No Real-time Availability**: Status is manual, not based on active bookings
5. **No Metrics/Analytics**: No dashboard or reporting yet

**These will be addressed in future phases.**
