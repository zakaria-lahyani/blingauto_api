# Scheduling System Test Suite

This test suite provides comprehensive testing for the BlingAuto car wash scheduling system, covering both core functionality and advanced features.

## Test Files Overview

### 1. `test_scheduling_management.py`
**Core Scheduling Management Tests**

Tests the fundamental scheduling operations with proper authorization and business logic:

#### Business Hours Management
- ✅ **Authorization Testing**: Only managers/admins can CRUD business hours
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete business hours
- ✅ **Validation**: Proper time format validation and constraint checking
- ✅ **Break Periods**: Support for lunch breaks and maintenance windows

#### Wash Bays Management  
- ✅ **Authorization Testing**: Only managers/admins can CRUD wash bays
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Full lifecycle management of wash bays
- ✅ **Equipment Tracking**: Bay-specific equipment and capabilities
- ✅ **Vehicle Size Matching**: Route appropriate vehicles to suitable bays

#### Smart Booking Engine
- ✅ **Time Slot Generation**: Slots based on business hours and service duration
- ✅ **Bay Availability Logic**: Multiple bays can handle concurrent bookings
- ✅ **Conflict Prevention**: No double-booking on same bay/time
- ✅ **Schedule Updates**: Booking confirmation reduces availability

#### Real-World Scenarios Tested
```python
# Example: 3 wash bays, 1-hour service
# Time slot 2:00 PM can accommodate 3 concurrent bookings
# After 1 booking confirmed at 2:00 PM on Bay 1:
# - Bay 1: UNAVAILABLE 2:00-3:00 PM  
# - Bay 2: AVAILABLE 2:00-3:00 PM
# - Bay 3: AVAILABLE 2:00-3:00 PM
```

# Enable detailed logging in test files
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
