# Wash Bay Capacity Management - Architecture Compliance

## Overview

This document details how the wash bay capacity management implementation strictly adheres to the clean architecture principles and enforced rules.

## Architecture Rules Compliance

### ✅ Rule 1: No Cross-Feature Imports

**Rule**: No feature imports another feature's internals; cross-feature sync calls go via a consumer-owned port + local adapter.

**Implementation**:
- **Port Location**: `app/features/bookings/ports/capacity_service.py`
  - Interface `IWashBayCapacityService` defined in **bookings** feature (consumer-owned)
  - No imports from `facilities` or any other feature

- **Adapter Location**: `app/features/bookings/adapters/capacity_service.py`
  - Implementation `WashBayCapacityService` in **bookings** feature
  - Uses **raw SQL queries** via SQLAlchemy `text()` to avoid cross-feature model imports
  - Queries `wash_bays` and `bookings` tables directly without importing models

**Before (Violation)**:
```python
# ❌ Cross-feature import
from app.features.scheduling.ports.capacity_service import IWashBayCapacityService
from app.features.facilities.adapters.models import WashBayModel
```

**After (Compliant)**:
```python
# ✅ Consumer-owned port
from app.features.bookings.ports.capacity_service import IWashBayCapacityService

# ✅ Raw SQL - no model imports
query = text("""
    SELECT id, bay_number, max_vehicle_size
    FROM wash_bays
    WHERE status = 'active' AND deleted_at IS NULL
""")
```

### ✅ Rule 2: Dependency Direction

**Rule**: api → use_cases → domain, use_cases → ports, adapters → ports (+ core)

**Verified Dependency Flow**:

1. **Domain Layer** (`app/features/bookings/domain/`)
   - ✅ Zero imports from other features
   - ✅ Zero imports from FastAPI/Pydantic
   - ✅ Only imports from `app.core` (errors, base types)

2. **Ports Layer** (`app/features/bookings/ports/`)
   - ✅ Only imports from own domain: `from app.features.bookings.domain import Booking`
   - ✅ Defines interfaces only (ABC)

3. **Use Cases Layer** (`app/features/bookings/use_cases/`)
   - ✅ Imports from own domain: `from app.features.bookings.domain import ...`
   - ✅ Imports from own ports: `from app.features/bookings.ports import ...`
   - ✅ Zero imports from adapters
   - ✅ Zero imports from other features

4. **Adapters Layer** (`app/features/bookings/adapters/`)
   - ✅ Imports from own ports: `from app.features.bookings.ports.capacity_service import ...`
   - ✅ Imports from core: `from app.core.db.base import Base`
   - ✅ Zero cross-feature model imports (removed `WashBayModel`, `MobileTeamModel`)

5. **API Layer** (`app/features/bookings/api/`)
   - ✅ Imports from use_cases: `from app.features.bookings.use_cases import ...`
   - ✅ Imports from adapters (for DI only): `from app.features.bookings.adapters.capacity_service import ...`
   - ✅ Zero cross-feature imports

### ✅ Rule 3: No Business Logic Outside Domain/Use Cases

**Rule**: No business logic in api or adapters. Policies live in domain.

**Implementation**:
- **Capacity Service Adapter** (`app/features/bookings/adapters/capacity_service.py`)
  - Contains **only** infrastructure code (SQL queries, data fetching)
  - No business rules about what constitutes "available" beyond basic overlap detection

- **Business Logic** is in **Use Case** (`app/features/bookings/use_cases/create_booking.py`)
  - Decides **when** to allocate wash bay (only for STATIONARY bookings)
  - Decides **what** to do when no capacity (reject booking with error)
  - Orchestrates the capacity check flow

```python
# ✅ Business logic in use case
if booking_type == BookingType.STATIONARY:
    wash_bay_id = await self._capacity_service.find_available_wash_bay(...)
    if not wash_bay_id:
        raise BusinessRuleViolationError("No available wash bay...")
    booking.wash_bay_id = wash_bay_id
```

### ✅ Rule 4: One Transaction Per Use Case

**Rule**: One transaction per initiating use case; no cross-feature shared DB transaction.

**Implementation**:
- **CreateBookingUseCase** manages the entire transaction
  - Checks capacity (read-only query)
  - Creates booking with wash_bay_id
  - Commits in single transaction via repository

- **Capacity Service** performs **read-only** queries
  - No writes, no transactions
  - Only queries existing data

### ✅ Rule 5: Domain Has Zero FastAPI/Pydantic Dependencies

**Rule**: Domain code has zero FastAPI/Pydantic dependencies.

**Verified**:
```bash
$ grep -r "from fastapi" app/features/bookings/domain/
# No results

$ grep -r "from pydantic" app/features/bookings/domain/
# No results
```

**Domain entities use**:
- `@dataclass` from Python standard library
- Python type hints
- No external web framework dependencies

## Database Schema Compliance

### Foreign Keys Without Model Imports

**Challenge**: How to reference `wash_bays` table without importing `WashBayModel`?

**Solution**: Use table name strings in ForeignKey

```python
# app/features/bookings/adapters/models.py
class Booking(Base, TimestampMixin):
    # ✅ Reference by table name, not model class
    wash_bay_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("wash_bays.id"), nullable=True)
    mobile_team_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("mobile_teams.id"), nullable=True)

    # ✅ Removed ORM relationships to avoid cross-feature imports
    # Note: wash_bay and mobile_team relationships removed
    # Use capacity service or direct SQL queries for details
```

**Migration** ([migrations/versions/003_add_resource_allocation_to_bookings.py](migrations/versions/003_add_resource_allocation_to_bookings.py)):
```python
# ✅ Creates foreign keys using table names
op.create_foreign_key(
    'fk_bookings_wash_bay_id',
    'bookings',      # source table
    'wash_bays',     # target table (by name, not model)
    ['wash_bay_id'],
    ['id'],
    ondelete='SET NULL'
)
```

## Raw SQL vs ORM

**Why Raw SQL in Capacity Service?**

Using raw SQL prevents cross-feature model imports while maintaining performance:

```python
# ✅ Raw SQL - no imports needed
query = text("""
    SELECT id, bay_number, max_vehicle_size
    FROM wash_bays
    WHERE status = 'active'
      AND deleted_at IS NULL
      AND max_vehicle_size = ANY(:compatible_sizes)
    ORDER BY bay_number
""")
result = await self._session.execute(query, {"compatible_sizes": compatible_sizes})
```

**vs**

```python
# ❌ Would require cross-feature import
from app.features.facilities.adapters.models import WashBayModel
query = select(WashBayModel).where(...)  # Violates architecture
```

## Dependency Injection Compliance

**Wiring** ([app/features/bookings/api/dependencies.py](app/features/bookings/api/dependencies.py)):

```python
# ✅ Import from own feature's adapter (not cross-feature)
from app.features.bookings.adapters.capacity_service import WashBayCapacityService

def get_capacity_service(
    uow: Annotated[UnitOfWork, Depends(get_unit_of_work)]
) -> WashBayCapacityService:
    """Get wash bay capacity service."""
    return WashBayCapacityService(uow.session)

def get_create_booking_use_case(
    # ... other dependencies ...
    capacity_service: Annotated[WashBayCapacityService, Depends(get_capacity_service)],
) -> CreateBookingUseCase:
    """Get create booking use case."""
    return CreateBookingUseCase(
        # ... other params ...
        capacity_service=capacity_service,
    )
```

## Testing Compliance

**Integration Tests** ([tests/test_wash_bay_capacity.py](tests/test_wash_bay_capacity.py)):
- ✅ Tests behavior through public API endpoints
- ✅ No direct imports of internal feature components
- ✅ Uses fixtures from conftest (follows test architecture)

## Summary

The wash bay capacity management implementation **fully complies** with clean architecture principles:

1. ✅ **No cross-feature imports** - Capacity service owned by bookings (consumer)
2. ✅ **Correct dependency direction** - All layers follow the dependency rule
3. ✅ **No business logic in adapters/API** - Logic stays in use cases
4. ✅ **Single transaction** - Use case controls the transaction boundary
5. ✅ **Domain purity** - No framework dependencies in domain layer
6. ✅ **Raw SQL for cross-table queries** - Avoids model import violations
7. ✅ **Port/Adapter pattern** - Consumer owns the port, provides adapter

This implementation serves as a reference for future cross-feature data access patterns.
