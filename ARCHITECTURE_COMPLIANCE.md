# 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE PATTERN COMPLIANCE

## ✅ EXACT PATTERN IMPLEMENTATION

### **Layer Structure per Feature**
```
feature/
├── domain/          # entities, policies (pure business logic)
├── ports/           # interfaces + domain entity re-exports
├── use_cases/       # application layer (orchestration)
├── adapters/        # DB/cache/external implementations
└── api/             # HTTP I/O only
```

### **Core Infrastructure Only**
```
core/
├── config/          # settings
├── db/              # database session, UoW
├── cache/           # Redis, rate limiting
├── errors/          # error handling
├── middleware/      # CORS, logging, security
├── observability/   # health, metrics
└── security/        # JWT, password, RBAC
```

### **Interfaces for Composition**
```
interfaces/
├── http_api.py      # FastAPI app factory
├── health.py        # health endpoints
└── openapi.py       # documentation
```

## 🔒 DEPENDENCY DIRECTION (ENFORCED)

### **Hard Rules**
- ✅ `api → use_cases → domain`
- ✅ `use_cases → ports`
- ✅ `adapters → ports (+ core)`
- ✅ `domain` = pure (zero external deps)
- ✅ NO feature-to-feature imports

### **Cross-Feature Communication Pattern**
```
Feature A (Consumer)
├── ports/external_services.py      # Consumer-owned interface
└── adapters/external_services.py   # Calls Feature B's public use case

Feature B (Provider)  
└── use_cases/public_operation.py   # Public interface
```

## 🛡️ ARCHITECTURE VIOLATIONS PREVENTED

### **1. No Business Logic in API/Adapters**
- ❌ Role checking in API dependencies 
- ✅ Authorization use cases in domain
- ❌ Business rules in adapters
- ✅ Policies in domain layer

### **2. No Direct Cross-Feature Imports**
- ❌ `auth` importing from `vehicles`
- ✅ Consumer-owned ports pattern
- ❌ Shared database models
- ✅ Feature-owned tables

### **3. No Framework Dependencies in Domain**
- ❌ FastAPI/Pydantic in domain
- ✅ Pure Python entities
- ❌ SQLAlchemy in business logic
- ✅ Repository interfaces in ports

### **4. No Adapter → Domain Imports**
- ❌ Adapters importing domain directly
- ✅ Adapters import via ports re-exports
- ❌ Circular dependencies
- ✅ Clean dependency flow

## 📋 COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### **Feature Structure** ✅
- [x] Domain contains entities + policies only
- [x] Ports define interfaces + re-export entities  
- [x] Use cases orchestrate business logic
- [x] Adapters implement ports (infrastructure)
- [x] API handles HTTP I/O only

### **Dependency Rules** ✅
- [x] api → use_cases → domain
- [x] use_cases → ports
- [x] adapters → ports + core
- [x] NO cross-feature imports
- [x] Domain has zero framework deps

### **Cross-Feature Communication** ✅
- [x] Consumer-owned ports defined
- [x] Adapters call public use cases
- [x] DTOs prevent coupling
- [x] No shared database transactions

### **Infrastructure Separation** ✅
- [x] Core contains only infrastructure
- [x] Interfaces does composition only
- [x] No business logic in infrastructure
- [x] Clear separation of concerns

## 🔧 ENFORCEMENT TOOLS

1. **Import-linter**: `.import-linter-strict`
2. **Architecture script**: `scripts/enforce_architecture.py`
3. **Consumer-owned ports**: Pattern examples provided
4. **Domain purity**: Zero framework dependencies verified

## 🎯 KEY PATTERNS IMPLEMENTED

### **Hexagonal Architecture**
- Ports/Adapters pattern enforced
- Domain isolated from infrastructure
- Dependency inversion throughout

### **Clean Architecture** 
- Dependency rule enforced (inward only)
- Business logic in domain/use_cases
- Framework details in outer layers

### **Domain-Driven Design**
- Domain entities are first-class
- Policies encapsulate business rules
- Ubiquitous language in domain

### **Consumer-Owned Ports**
- Cross-feature calls via interfaces
- Loose coupling between features
- Public use cases as integration points

**RESULT**: Architecture now STRICTLY follows the mandated pattern with automated enforcement! 🎉
