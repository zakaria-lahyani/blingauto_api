## Technical Debt

None identified yet. All completed code follows clean architecture principles and best practices.

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Database Performance
**Issue**: Complex queries for analytics may be slow
**Mitigation**: Use database indexes, caching, read replicas

### Risk 2: File Storage Scaling
**Issue**: Local file storage for staff documents may not scale
**Mitigation**: S3 adapter already designed, can switch easily

### Risk 3: Real-time Reporting
**Issue**: Daily reports may need real-time updates
**Mitigation**: Use Redis caching, WebSocket for live updates

---

## Questions for Product Owner

1. **Inventory**: Do we need barcode scanning support?
2. **Expenses**: Do we need multi-level approval workflow?
3. **Analytics**: What time zone should reports use?
4. **General**: Do we need data export (CSV/Excel) for all features?
5. **General**: Do we need email/SMS notifications for any events?
