## 🔐 Security & Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Endpoint Category | Admin | Manager | Washer | Client |
|-------------------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| Business Hours CRUD | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Wash Bays CRUD | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Mobile Teams CRUD | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Booking Creation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Availability Check | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Analytics Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Route Optimization | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Authentication Implementation
```python
# Example authorization check
def require_manager_or_admin(current_user: AuthUser = Depends(get_current_active_user)):
    if current_user.role not in [AuthRole.ADMIN, AuthRole.MANAGER]:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied")
    return current_user
```

## 🤖 Smart Booking Engine Features

### 1. **Intelligent Time Slot Generation**
- Respects business hours and break periods
- Considers service duration requirements
- Accounts for bay-specific capabilities
- Factors in buffer time between bookings

### 2. **Multi-Bay Availability Logic**
```python
# Example: 3 wash bays can handle concurrent bookings
# Time slot 2:00 PM can accommodate 3 simultaneous services:
# Bay 1: BOOKED 2:00-3:00 PM
# Bay 2: AVAILABLE 2:00-3:00 PM  
# Bay 3: AVAILABLE 2:00-3:00 PM
```

### 3. **Dynamic Conflict Resolution**
- Real-time conflict detection
- Alternative time slot suggestions
- Customer preference matching
- Automatic waitlist management

### 4. **Confidence Scoring Algorithm**
```python
def calculate_confidence_score(slot_time, bay, preferred_time, service_type):
    score = 0.5  # Base score
    
    # Time preference matching (+0.3)
    if preferred_time_matches(slot_time, preferred_time):
        score += 0.3
    
    # Bay suitability (+0.2)
    if bay_suitable_for_service(bay, service_type):
        score += 0.2
    
    # Peak time adjustment (-0.05 for very busy times)
    if is_peak_hour(slot_time):
        score -= 0.05
    
    return min(1.0, max(0.1, score))
```

## 📈 Revenue Optimization Features

## 🔄 Booking Lifecycle with Schedule Updates

### 1. **Booking Creation Process**
```python
# Step 1: Pre-booking validation
availability_check = await smart_booking.check_availability_advanced(...)

# Step 2: Dynamic pricing calculation  
pricing_info = await smart_booking.calculate_booking_price(...)

# Step 3: Create booking entity
booking = await booking_service.create_booking(...)

# Step 4: Update schedule and allocate resources
schedule_result = await smart_booking.update_schedule_for_booking(...)

# Step 5: Update capacity allocations
await smart_booking.update_capacity_allocation(...)
```
