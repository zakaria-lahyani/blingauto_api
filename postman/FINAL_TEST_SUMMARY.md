## 🚀 Execution Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Import all collections and environment into Postman
# 2. Select "BlingAuto - Local" environment
# 3. Run collections in order (00 → 10)

# Using Newman CLI:
newman run collections/00-Master-Configuration.postman_collection.json \
  -e environments/BlingAuto-Local.postman_environment.json

# Repeat for collections 01-10
```

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run the provided shell script
chmod +x run-all-tests.sh
./run-all-tests.sh
```

---

## 📋 Test Patterns Used

### 1. **Environment Variable Chaining**
Tests automatically set variables for subsequent tests:
```javascript
pm.environment.set('test_booking_id', response.booking_id);
```

### 2. **Dynamic Test Data**
Timestamp-based unique identifiers prevent conflicts:
```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now();
pm.environment.set('test_email', `user${timestamp}@example.com`);
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Assertions**
Multiple validation layers per test:
```javascript
pm.expect(response).to.have.property('id');
pm.expect(response.status).to.equal('completed');
pm.expect(response.total_amount).to.be.above(0);
```

### 4. **Business Logic Validation**
Not just API contracts, but business rules:
```javascript
pm.expect(response.discount_amount).to.equal(7.50);
pm.expect(response.final_amount).to.equal(67.50);
```

### 5. **State Machine Testing**
Workflow validation across multiple requests:
- pending → confirmed → in_progress → completed
- pending → approved → paid
- available → booked → cancelled
